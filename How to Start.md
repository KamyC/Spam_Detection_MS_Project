# How to Start
### Clone the project

1. Firstly, it is recommended to install git, so that you can simply use 'git  clone' command to clone the whole project and develop locally.
2. Secondly, you can create your own repository to manage the code in Github. It is strongly recommended to do so, because you can have historical versions of all the committed codes in case you need to roll back.

### Set up the development environment

1. IDE: Pycharm Professional Ver. You can use the school email to activate and get a professional version for free.

2. Interpreter: Python 3.6 or higher

3. Libraries:

You do not necessarily install the package one by one. I recommend Pycharm because it can automatically install all the above. If you find any package missing, you can also manually install it.

### Run this project

1. Open this project in Pycharm and have all the packages installed.
2. Right click the app.py, click Run.
3. In the terminal, you can see this line : Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit) 
4. Click the link and you are free to go.

### Tips

1. I have already pushed some user data into the database. So you can simply log in using

   Email: test_user@mail.com
   Password: 123

   to log in and see the dashboard.

2. It is recommended to install Database Tools and SQL in Pycharm as a plugin. Then you can view the database in the IDE. It is quite convenient.
